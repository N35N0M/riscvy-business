Master's project: Fusing together RISC-V and GRLIB

The FreeAHB, GRLIB and PicoRV components are existing works by other creators. I have forked specific commits for version freezing and safekeeping, and only made minor modifications in separate commits in order to facilitate integration of the IPs, and do not claim these components as my work whatsoever. Credit is very much due to its original contributors.
